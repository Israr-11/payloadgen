# Privacy Policy for PayloadGen

## Data Collection

PayloadGen is designed with privacy in mind and operates entirely locally within your VS Code environment:

- **No Data Collection**: PayloadGen does not collect, transmit, or store any of your code or generated payloads.
- **No Telemetry**: We do not include any telemetry or tracking mechanisms.
- **Local Processing**: All code analysis and payload generation happens locally on your machine.

## Code Access

PayloadGen only accesses:
- The code you explicitly select when using the extension
- The active editor content when you trigger the extension

This access is solely for the purpose of analyzing your code to generate appropriate test payloads and is never transmitted outside your local environment.

## Third-Party Libraries

PayloadGen uses the following third-party libraries:
- **@faker-js/faker**: For generating fake data
- **ts-morph**: For TypeScript/JavaScript code analysis

These libraries operate entirely within your local environment and do not transmit data externally.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update our privacy practices, we will update this privacy policy and note the changes in our changelog.
